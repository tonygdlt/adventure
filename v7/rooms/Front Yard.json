		"longDescription":"The yard in front of you is is overgrown with grass and weeds reaching at least knee height. The stone walkway leading up to the porch of the dilapidated house can barely be seen among the overgrowth. The cracked driveway curves around to the side of the house, and out of sight. Your car is parked in the driveway to the south. To the west, beyond the edge of the yard, looms a dense, dark forest. A feeling comes over you that it's just waiting for you to turn you back so it can swallow you whole. With some effort you pull your eyes away, and look to the east. You can just barely see the porch light of the neighbor's house through the trees. The house to the north definately looks like it hasn't been lived in for five years. There are several broken or boarded up windows, and the paint was peeling on the majority of the house. If you believed in haunted houses it would certainly fit that image.",
		"shortDescription":"The yard is overgrown with grass and weeds. You can see you car parked in the driveway to the south, just opposite the porch. The neighbor's house is to the east. To the west is the ominous forest. To the north is the front porch of the house.",
